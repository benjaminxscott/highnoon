# Ace of Blades
Take a regular deck and remove all face cards, leave only the ace of spades and numbered cards (37 total)

Start each player with starts with 5 cards from a shuffled deck

## The Choice
Each round, players choose a card value to play

> Multiple cards of different suits and identical value are treated as one card with no advantage or disadvantage to playing them

## The Showdown

Card values are compared and judged:
- Discard all cards of the lowest value
- If all cards are the same value, they are all discarded
- If the Ace of Spades was played, all cards are discarded

If either player has the Ace of Spades, they may play it and choose any card value to discard

> After playing the Ace, it transfers to the opposing player

## The Aftermath
After the showdown, both players draw a card from the shuffled deck

> Win by discarding your entire hand, or having the fewest cards when the draw pile is empty
